                    <dd>I have started learning about filmmaking and also making films recently. The process of filmmaking is tough and fun at the same time, which intrigues me more. I am exploring the different parts of the process, be it scriptwriting, cinematography, editing or direction.</dd>

                    <dd>Working with Photoshop and Blender, I have developed a new-found interest in the field of designing, graphics and 3D Animation. Recreating real-life objects using 2D and 3D computer graphics helps form a connection between the real and virtual worlds.</dd>
