                        <h2>CODING</h2>
                        <p>I am familiar with a few programming languages like Python, C and C++, and I love to code logical programs and play with algorithms. I have also explored competitive programming and tried out various other applications of programming, such as game development.</p>

                        <h2>FILMMAKING</h2>
                        <p>I have started learning about filmmaking and also making films recently. The process of filmmaking is tough and fun at the same time, which intrigues me more. I am exploring the different parts of the process, be it scriptwriting, cinematography, editing or direction.</p>

                        <h2>ROBOTICS</h2>
                        <p>I have always been desperate to build stuff and get my hands dirty making something which could help the world be a better place. This is what attracted me towards engineering. Robotics lets me use my creativitiy and logical skills while working with circuits and building bots.</p>

                        <h2>DESIGNING AND ANIMATION</h2>
                        <p>Working with Photoshop and Blender, I have developed a new-found interest in the field of designing, graphics and 3D Animation. Recreating real-life objects using 2D and 3D computer graphics helps form a connection between the real and virtual worlds.</p>
